This project was created during the 4th year internship period from 04/21/2022 to 06/25/2022 in college. 2 people worked on the project who had no experience in mobile game development, but we received some recommendations from other people who are related to game development. Most of their recommendations related to the correct development of the game in such a way as to reach a large audience. Our design and playability were also judged.

The project is not finished, but there is already an opportunity to play and try the first 10 levels.

# About the project:
Title: Canteen Assault   
Genre: Tower Defense

A team of 6 novice video game developers (including those who developed this project) proposed the idea of developing a video game in which the player must protect the school cafeteria from the attack of hungry schoolchildren. To do this, he places the staff of the school (teachers, etc.) in different places. They attack schoolchildren, preventing them from reaching the end of the level.

A non-level player will be able to buy an upgrade opportunity for his school employees at a level for local currency (stars).

The player spends a resource (coins) to install and improve workers, which he earns and spends only at the level. From each enemy eliminated, the player receives a specific amount of resource, and there is also a chance that additional resources will drop after the enemy is eliminated.

Also, the player is able to use the abilities "Dancing" and "Meatballs" to help themselves on the level:
- Dancing is an ability that activates and stops all enemies on stage. All enemies start dancing.
- Meatballs is an ability that activates. The player must aim at the target by tapping and tapping on the screen and hit the students with meatballs, causing them some damage.

The player can complete 2 tasks at each level. Each completed task rewards the player with internal currency (stars).
